# electronic-kapitsa-waves
Simulation and analysis of Kapitsa-like instabilities in electron fluids. Implements hydrodynamic modeling, dispersion relation derivation, and phase diagram mapping for graphene and related materials. Inspired by P. Kapitsaâ€™s roll waves and recent advances in quantum hydrodynamics.
