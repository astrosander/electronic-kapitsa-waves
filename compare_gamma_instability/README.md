# Studying the density instability from diccipation coefficient $\Gamma$ 
**The most interesting to discover is that with the increase of the dissipation coefficient the density counter-intuitively increases as well.**

Because of the compilation time, the code is suggested to compile in multithereading with `compare_gamma_instability_multithreading.py` for example, and later restore the
