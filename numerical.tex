The partial differential equation (PDE) system solved is as follows:
\begin{align}
\partial_t n &= -\partial_x p + D_n \partial_{xx} n, \label{eq:n_eq} \\[6pt]
\partial_t p &= -\gamma(n) p 
- \partial_x \left( \frac{1}{2} U n^2 + \frac{p^2}{m n} \right) \notag \\
&\quad + e n E_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) 
+ D_p \partial_{xx} p. \label{eq:p_eq}
\end{align}
We solve numerically the one-dimensional hydrodynamic system \eqref{eq:n_eq}-\eqref{eq:p_eq} on a periodic interval $x\in[0,L)$. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 have been produced by the numerical methods, described below.
The unknowns are the density $n(x,t)$ and the momentum density $p(x,t)=mnu$.
Periodic boundary conditions are imposed at $x=0$ and $x=L$.
Spatial derivatives are calculated in Fourier space for maximal accuracy, and the time evolution is advanced using a stiff, adaptive-step Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) integrator.
Throughout, divisions by $n$ are regularized with $n_{\min}=10^{-7}$ in denominators; this has no discernible effect on converged solutions but avoids numerical singularities.

All fields are represented by discrete Fourier series on an equispaced grid of $N_x$ points. Higher $N_x$ discretization time causes linear growth of the run-time. At the same time, we aim to maintain a resolution of at least 30–50 grid points per full oscillation of $n(x)$.

For improved numerical accuracy and reduced computational cost, the spatial derivatives in Eqs. \eqref{eq:n_eq}–\eqref{eq:p_eq} are computed in Fourier space by multiplying the field by $ik$ and $-k^2$, for the first and second derivatives, respectively, and subsequently transforming back to physical space. 
Nonlinear products (such as the pressure and damping contributions) are formed pointwise in $x$ and returned to Fourier space by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

To control aliasing from these nonlinearities we apply the Orszag 2/3 truncation rule: after each right-hand-side evaluation we zero all modes with $|k|> (2/3)k_{\max}$, where $k_{\max}=\pi/\Delta x$ and $\Delta x=L/N_x$. When fields are multiplied, the nonlinear math generates artificial high-frequency waves that can wrap around and show up where they don't belong. By keeping only the lowest two-thirds of Fourier modes and zeroing the rest, we stop those fake signals from leaking into the range we care about.

The semi-discrete system is advanced using a variable-order \emph{BDF} integrator implemented through the \emph{solve\_ivp} function with the \emph{BDF} method, based on SciPy library. The solver used the relative and absolute tolerances $\mathrm{rtol}=10^{-4}$ and $\mathrm{atol}=10^{-7}$. These tolerance values were determined through numerical experiments as optimal: reducing them further increases runtime, while loosening them may introduce numerical artifacts. Therefore, when accuracy concerns arise, it is recommended to refine the spatial discretization $N_x$ and adjust the tolerance parameters accordingly.

Only the time step adapts, in response to the local error estimator.
The spatial discretization is fixed once a run begins: both the number of grid points $N_x$ and the domain length $L$ remain constant for the duration of the simulation. 

The domain is chosen so that the discrete wavenumber set $\{k_m=2\pi m/L\}$ contains the most unstable linear wavenumber $k^*$ predicted by the stability analysis and does not vary with time.
We first pick an integer $M \in \mathbb{N}$ representing the intended number of wavelengths in the box and set
\begin{equation} 
 L=\frac{2\pi M}{k^*}
\end{equation}
so that $k^*$ coincides exactly with the grid mode $k_M$.
We then select $N_x$ large enough that the de-aliased band retains not only $k^*$ but also its first few harmonics; in practice we enforce $M\le N_x/8$.
The box size and initial conditions is decided before the run and is not altered during simulation.

Simulations start from a spatially uniform drifting state, $n(x,0)=\bar n$ and $p(x,0)=m\bar nu_d$.
To seed pattern formation we add a small, deterministic superposition of cosine modes,
\begin{equation}
 n(x,0)=\bar n + A_n\sum_{j\in\mathcal S}\cos\Big(\tfrac{2\pi j}{L}x\Big),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 p(x,0)=m\bar nu_d + A_p\sum_{j\in\mathcal S}\cos\Big(\tfrac{2\pi j}{L}x\Big),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal S$ is a finite set of low integers (for example $\{3,5,7\}$) and $A_n,A_p$ are small amplitudes (typically $0.03$). As shown on Fig. 2, regardless of initial conditions, the system
converges to the same spatial pattern. 

The density-dependent damping is implemented as Eq.\textcolor{red}{~5}. The pressure entering the momentum balance is Eq.\textcolor{red}{~9}. 
The electric field is uniform in space.
